# Life-Calendar

Inspired by [Tim Urban's Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU),
I made this chrome extension to show you the morbid reality of how little time you have left to live.

You can download the extension from chrome webstore [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/life-calendar/ehkopmgbaklbnbdlhmaddkddjbhnkajo)
